//VERY HARD: You are given coins of different denominations 
//and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to 
//compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up 
//that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any 
//combination of the coins, return -1.
//Hint:  Sudo code this problem. Focus on breaking the problem 
//down into steps  Use functions, arrays and logical operators.  
//Do not have anyone give you the answer or solve this problem for you. 

//1-create function
//2-create variable = array
//3- create a IF logical operator.
//4-amount = 11, coins [1, 2, 5 ]
